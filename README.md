# Smart Traffic Management using YOLOv8 🚦

This project detects vehicles in real-time using YOLOv8 and dynamically estimates traffic signal timing based on vehicle density.

## Features
- Real-time vehicle detection
- Traffic density classification (Low / Medium / Heavy)
- Estimated Green Time calculation
- Live webcam support

## Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- PyTorch

## How to Run

1. Create virtual environment:
   python -m venv venv

2. Activate:
   venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run:
   python main.py
